# Logistic_Regression_Predictive_Model
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false.
